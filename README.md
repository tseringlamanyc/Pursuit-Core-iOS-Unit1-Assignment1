## Lab 

This lab will build on the skills that you've learned after your first week of programming in Swift!  You will build a command line application that plays a text-based adventure game.  Look [here](https://classicreload.com/zork-i.html) and [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/1g84m0sXpnNCv84GpN2PLZG/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-galaxy-game-30th-anniversary-edition) for a couple examples of the genre.  Be creative with your app.  Submit your assignment by copying and pasting your code into the text box below. Apps will be evaluated by the following criteria:   

## App requirements:

<li>Your command line app must build and run with no compiler errors or warnings</li>
<li>Have at least 10 opportunities for the user to make decisions</li>
<li>Have at least one opportunity where the user will enter a number (see converting Strings to numbers)</li>
<li>Use both Switch statements and If/Else Statements</li>
<li>Use both type annotation and type inference to set variables</li>
<li>Use at least one tuple in your code</li>
<li>Use at least range in your code</li>
<li>Use a for loop in your code</li>
<li>Use a while loop in your code</li>
 

## Hints:

Use the following line to get user input

```swift 
let response = readLine()
//The type of response is Optional String
```

Converting String to a number Type

```swift 
let userEnteredNumAsString = readLine()!
let userEnteredNumAsInt = Int(userEnteredNumAsString)! 
//This will crash if you don't have a valid Int
```

Sample code with conditional logic:

```swift
print("Your adventure begins! Choose your direction \"Up\" or \"Down\"") //Use \ to escape characters

let UpOrDown = readLine()!
var weapon = "" //Set variables here and you can change and use their values later
var eggExploded = false
switch UpOrDown {
case "Up":
    print("You see a basket of eggs.  How many do you take?")
    let eggNum = readLine()!
    let eggNumAsInt = Int(eggNum)!
    for currentEgg in 1...eggNumAsInt {
        print("You carefully remove egg number \(currentEgg)")
        if currentEgg == 4 {
            print("It was a trap!  The egg explodes")
                eggExploded = true
        }
    }
    if !eggExploded {
        print("Congrats!  You made it out with \(eggNumAsInt) eggs!")
    }
    //More decisions ahead! Use conditionals and switch statements here

case "Down":
    print("Down you go!")
    //Instructions for the "Down" option ahead!
default:
    print("You stand your ground. Choose a weapon")
    weapon = readLine()!
    //Fighting conditionals ahead!
}

if weapon != "" {
    print("You survived your first ordeal and even have a \(weapon) to take home")
}
if eggExploded {
    print("Bad luck!  Don't take so many eggs")
}
```
